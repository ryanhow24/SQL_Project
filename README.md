## Introduction
Taking a deeper look into the data job market, I looked specifically at data analyst roles to discover the top-paying jobs, the most in-demand skills, and the most optimal skills to learn (where demand = salary).

Check out the SQL queries [here.](/project_sql/)

## Background
As a way to develop my SQL skills further, I took on this project from [Luke Barousse's](https://www.lukebarousse.com/) Youtube channel.

The provided dataset contains information about job postings across many different domains in the data field, although I stayed focus to my domain of data analytics.

### What were the questions I wanted to answer?
1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn?

### Tools I Used
- **SQL**: To query the database.
- **PostgreSQL**: Chosen db management.
- **VSCode**: My preferred place to run my code.
- **Git/GitHub**: For sharing my progress!
